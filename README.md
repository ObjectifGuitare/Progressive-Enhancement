# The chinese farmer exercise

This exercise is one of BeCode's first coding exercise. It is meant to introduce the learners to basic HTML and css principles, such as:

*   Using the right html tag for the right context in order to improve our SEO
*   Using basic and less basic CSS selectors to play with a variety of properties
*   Using flexbox

to name a few...

The "exercise-sheet" can be found on a BeCode private repository. It gave the whole text that you can see on semantics.html so that we just had to add the code.
